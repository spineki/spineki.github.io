- To understand and code your own ray-tracer engine step by step: [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). The project is written in C++, but can easily be written in the language you love the most. With this experience, it's easier to do the same with shaders on a GPU.
