So, why not put everything in one place?

## Mathematics

- To get a list of remarkable integer sequences: [OEIS](https://oeis.org/). This can be useful if you know the first terms of a suit to quickly check if a corresponding formula exists.
- To learn how to be able to type math with latex faster than one could imagine: [How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)
- To understand how fluid simulation works, with mathematical explanations and equations (finally!) applied to WebGL [Fluid Simulation](https://jamie-wong.com/2016/08/05/webgl-fluid-simulation/)

## Programming

### Algorithms

- To get a list of common NP algorithms, with state-of-the_art information : [the viggo compendium](https://www.csc.kth.se/tcs/compendium/).
- To get a list of common programming patterns used in Video Games but helpful in "regular" codes: [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)

### C++

- To learn C++, [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) is a beautiful website, with modern cpp practices and in-depth explanations.

### Rust

- The book, the holly bible to learn and understand Rust: [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- The rustonomicon, the evil bible to learn and understand unsafe Rust: [The Nomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)

- An online playground to test and run Rust code without installing anything: [The Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
- An insightful blog about programming, that dives deep into the Rust language with a readable dialog-like style: [FasterthanLime](https://fasterthanli.me/)

### GPU

- To understand and code your own ray-tracer engine step by step: [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). The project is written in C++, but can easily be written in the language you love the most. With this experience, it is easier to do the same with shaders on a GPU.
- To get a grasp on fragment shader uses for image creation and simulation: [The Book Of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/).
- To test your shader in an already set-up environment or look at others people shaders: [Shader Toy](https://www.shadertoy.com)

### HDL

- To learn verilog, [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) provides exercices from simple warm-ups to complex chip structures.
- Additional documentation can be found on [Chipverify](https://www.chipverify.com/).
